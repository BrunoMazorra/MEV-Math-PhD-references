It introduces a theoretical framework and practical implementation of the mechanism, and studies the false-name proofness of the mechanism and its applications on funding relayer sets in Blockchain. It also discusses the use of online learning and convex online learning to minimize regret, and provides a proof that the mechanism is Î±(n)-approximate.\n",
